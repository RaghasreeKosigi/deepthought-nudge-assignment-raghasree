3. Problem Framing
3.1 Behavior to Improve

New team members hesitate to share ideas and often remain silent during discussions.

3.2 Why This Happens

Key psychological factors:

Social comparison

Fear of judgment

Low psychological safety

These patterns are consistent with social anxiety and self-efficacy theory.

3.3 Importance

Improving this behavior supports:

Faster team integration

Better collaboration

Enhanced confidence

A more open and productive team culture

3.4 Target User

New team members in their first 2–3 weeks.

3.5 Scope Exclusion

This nudge will not teach idea-generation skills.
It focuses only on increasing confidence and contribution.

4. Four-Layer Nudge Design
4.1 Input Trigger

User is observed browsing team discussions for more than 10 minutes without contributing.

4.2 State Inference

Likely emotional state:

Hesitation

Low confidence

Fear of being wrong

Reasoning:
These indicators align with low self-efficacy and social anxiety.

4.3 Nudge Message

Primary Message:
“2 teammates shared their ideas this hour. Your perspective could enrich the conversation—want to share it?”

Goal:
To reinforce belonging, reduce hesitation, and gently encourage participation.

4.4 Delivery Design

Delivered through a peer-triggered dashboard prompt

Tone is soft, supportive, and non-intrusive

5. Behavioral Test Simulations
Case	Situation	Likely Reaction	Adjustment
Case 1: Receptive Person	Already planning to share	Feels supported and contributes	No change required
Case 2: Resistant Person	Feels insecure despite the nudge	Ignores or postpones sharing	Use a softer version: “Whenever you feel ready…”
